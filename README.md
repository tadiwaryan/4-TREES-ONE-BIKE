# 4-TREES-ONE-BIKE
Week Zero CS50 Problem Set.

- This project was built using Scratch 3 so in order to run the program you require the said version of scratch.
- Just click on File ( Top Left ) and choose Load from Computer.
- I think i fulfilled the problem requirements quite well and i used my understanding of coding building blocks to craft simple game.
- The incorrect thing i did was not using psuedocode and creating my algorithm before actually starting to build, this made the process longer and disoriented.

- I donno if anyone will actually read this...probably not.

- This project was made with love from London, Uk.
